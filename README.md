# creating-a-vertical-timeline

This project  aims at aiding learners of various institutions to acess already planned cousre content that displays from top to bottom o wheel up action . It entails an interactive vertical timeline that responds to mouse over event to reveal the context of a day and runs the topic and details to be covered with unveiling of subtopics in description .the following day context is revealed on scroll down.This project uses html ,css for styling  and javascript for interactivity.I designed the .dbjson API and tested it on postman and google chrome .The reason i chose this was to make my project to be more precise and communicative .i added a live link so that it can be acessed from other computers

This project is meant to guide learners in daily content interaction.

Using the mouse wheel up events display from either right or left.first initialize the terminal api by running
1.npm install -g json-server
2.json-server --watch db.json
then refresh on browser
